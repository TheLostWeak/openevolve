## TASK (DO EXACTLY THIS)

Return a COMPLETE replacement of the program source file.

The program MUST define:

```
def get_C():
```

and MUST return a NON-EMPTY Python list of points.

Each point:

* is a list or tuple
* has EXACTLY 11 coordinates
* ALL coordinates are EXACT INTEGERS

---

## OBJECTIVE (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY)

Maximize |C|, the number of points returned by `get_C()`.

If ANY constraint is violated, the solution is considered INVALID.
A smaller VALID set is ALWAYS better than a larger INVALID one.

---

## HARD CONSTRAINTS (NO EXCEPTIONS)

### C0 - Integer-only geometry

* Every coordinate MUST be an integer literal.
* Floating-point numbers, fractions, or computed normals are FORBIDDEN.

### C1 - Origin exclusion

* The zero vector (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) MUST NOT appear in C.

### C2 - Distance domination constraint

Let ||x|| denote the Euclidean norm.
Define max_norm as the maximum norm over C:

```
max_norm = max(||x|| for x in C)
```

For EVERY pair of DISTINCT points x != y in C, it MUST hold that:

```
||x - y|| >= max_norm
```

This condition is GLOBAL and applies to ALL pairs.

Attempting to evade this constraint by scaling, symmetry tricks,
or post-hoc normalization will be treated as INVALID.

## OUTPUT FORMAT (PREFERRED — RELAXED FOR ROBUSTNESS)

- Preferred: Return a single fenced Python code block containing a valid module that defines `def get_C():` and returns the required data.
    - The preferred opening fence is three backticks followed by `python` and a newline: ```python
    - The preferred closing fence is three backticks on its own line: ```
- Robustness: If the model includes a short human-readable explanation immediately before or after the code block, or uses simple Python expressions (for example `[1] + [0] * 10` or small constant expressions) that evaluate to integer literals at runtime, that is acceptable for this template. The system will attempt to extract and evaluate simple expressions if safe.
- The code should remain importable (no interactive input required). Avoid external network calls or writing files. Small explanatory comments inside the code block are acceptable.

Note: This template prefers the strict single-block form but tolerates minor surrounding text or simple expressions to improve robustness across model outputs.

---

## STRATEGY GUIDANCE (DO NOT IGNORE)

* Think in terms of discrete geometry and combinatorial constructions.
* Validity is binary. Do not guess. Do not approximate.
* If unsure, return fewer points.
* Important note about scaling and magnitude:
    - Uniformly scaling every coordinate by the same factor does NOT change whether a set is valid or invalid: the distance constraint is scale-invariant. Multiplying all coordinates by a constant will multiply both `max_norm` and all pairwise distances by the same factor, leaving constraints unchanged.
    - Nonetheless, using larger integer magnitudes increases the discrete set of available integer vectors at larger radii. In practice this provides the model more combinatorial choices to place MORE well-separated integer points.
    - Therefore we STRONGLY recommend preferring constructions that use larger integer magnitudes (for example, include points with norms larger than 1,000,000,000,000) because this expands the search space in a way that can produce better scale-invariant packings.

## RESPONSE SANITY CHECK (PREFERRED)

Before replying, aim to satisfy as many of the following as possible. If the strict checks cannot be met, prefer a conservative valid solution and the system may perform a light extraction step to salvage the code:
- The source defines `def get_C():` at top level.
- `get_C()` returns a non-empty Python list (literal lists/tuples preferred). Simple expressions that evaluate to integer literals are acceptable.
- Every point in the returned list should have 11 coordinates (integers preferred).
- The origin (11 zeros) should not be present.

If the model cannot safely meet all constraints, return a smaller but valid set rather than an invalid one. The system will attempt safe, automated extraction/cleanup if small deviations occur.

---

## FAILURE MODES (AUTOMATIC REJECTION)

The output is INVALID if ANY of the following occur:

* Any coordinate is non-integer.
* Any point has length != 11.
* The origin is included.
* Any pair violates the distance condition.
* Output includes more than one code block.
* Output includes any text outside the code block.

---

## MINIMAL VALID EXAMPLE (NOT OPTIMAL)

```python
def get_C():
    d = 11
    return [
        [1] + [0] * (d - 1),
        [0, 1] + [0] * (d - 2),
    ]
```

## LARGE-MAGNITUDE EXAMPLE (VALID, ILLUSTRATIVE)

```python
def get_C():
    # Example using large integer magnitudes (literal integers)
    return [
        [1000000000000, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1000000000000, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    ]
```

Return ONLY the program source code.
