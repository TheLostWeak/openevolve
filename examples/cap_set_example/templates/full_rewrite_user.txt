You are allowed and encouraged to produce a complete, runnable Python module
that constructs a large cap set in F_3^n.

IMPORTANT: For this task, fix the dimension to n = 6.

A cap set is a subset A of F_3^n such that there are no three *distinct*
elements x, y, z in A with x + y + z ≡ 0 (mod 3) coordinate-wise.

Your goal is to maximize |A|. Correctness is mandatory; larger sets score higher.

## REQUIREMENTS

- Output at least one COMPLETE, runnable Python file.
- The file must define:

    def generate_set(n) -> List[Tuple[int, ...]]

  which returns a cap set with entries in 0/1/2.

- Only Python standard library imports are allowed.

- If randomness is used:
  - Define a module-level constant `_RANDOM_SEED`
  - Seed all RNGs deterministically

## STRUCTURE-ORIENTED GUIDANCE

The evaluator prefers cap sets that display clear mathematical structure
(for example: symmetry, regular block/tiling patterns, orbit decompositions,
affine/subspace constructions, or other compact parametric families). When
producing a solution, favor constructions that expose and exploit such
structure rather than merely listing many individual vectors.

Guidelines:

- **Prefer structural descriptions:** produce generators or parametric
  constructions (rules, formulas, or small building blocks) that generate
  the set, instead of embedding long explicit lists of vectors.
- **Encourage symmetry and invariance:** constructions that are invariant
  under coordinate permutations, cyclic shifts, or group actions are valuable.
- **Use compact encodings:** describe the set as orbits, repeated tiles,
  cartesian products, affine translates, or other compact encodings when
  possible.
- **Structure summary:** include a short bullet summary naming the key
  structural features (e.g., "cyclic shifts of base block B", "decomposes
  into 3 orbits under rotation", "product of smaller cap sets").
- **Reproducibility:** if randomness is used, expose `_RANDOM_SEED` and make
  default runs deterministic so the construction can be replayed.

Examples of structural ideas (non-exhaustive and optional): coordinate-wise
patterns, cyclic/group orbits, product constructions, affine-subspace
restrictions, block-tilings, and parameterized templates.

Programs that provide a compact, structural description of the cap set and
an accompanying short explanation of the invariants will be scored more
favorably than programs that only output large enumerations.

## IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS (IMPORTANT)

- Keep runtime bounded and predictable.
- Avoid super-exponential or unbounded loops.
- If your approach is potentially expensive, introduce explicit limits such as:

    MAX_ITERATIONS
    MAX_RESTARTS
    TIME_LIMIT_SECONDS
    MAX_CANDIDATES

- Prefer incremental or local checks over full O(|A|^3) verification.
  Useful ideas include:
  - Precomputing forbidden third points
  - Encoding vectors as base-3 integers
  - Maintaining conflict counters
  - Sampling candidate moves

- When unsure, prefer a SMALL, SAFE modification over a full rewrite.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return ONLY a full Python module, enclosed in:

```python
<full module text>
````

## DOCUMENTATION (LIGHTWEIGHT)

At the top of the file, include brief comments explaining:

* The high-level idea of your construction/search
* Why this strategy might find larger cap sets

Do NOT include external references or excessive explanation.

---

## NOTES FOR THE MODEL

* The evaluator will call generate_set(6).
* Invalid cap sets score 0.
* Larger valid cap sets score higher.
* Simpler, more robust programs are preferred over fragile cleverness.
