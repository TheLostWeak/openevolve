You are allowed and encouraged to produce a complete, runnable Python module implementing a cap-set generator for F_3^n.

Requirements
- Provide at least one complete Python file that defines `def generate_set(n): -> List[Tuple[int,...]]` returning a cap set with coordinates in 0/1/2.
- You may produce multiple full variants. If you also include a SEARCH/REPLACE patch, include the full rewritten file below the patch.
- You are NOT limited to greedy algorithms. Creative approaches (randomized search, simulated annealing, genetic procedures, combinatorial constructions, multi-start heuristics) are allowed and welcomed.
- Ensure the output is valid Python and uses only standard library imports.
- Keep the module self-contained so it can be run as `python <file>`.

Output format and instructions
- If returning a full file, wrap it between the markers below so automated tooling can easily detect full-module responses:

--- FULL MODULE START ---
```python
<full module text>
```
--- FULL MODULE END ---

- If also providing a patch, use:

--- PATCH START ---
<SEARCH/REPLACE style patch>
--- PATCH END ---

Guidelines
- The evaluator will call `generate_set(n)`; invalid sets receive score 0. Ensure the function returns a list/tuple of length-n tuples with values 0/1/2.
- If your method uses randomness, expose a module-level `_RANDOM_SEED` variable and seed the RNG so results can be reproduced.
- Prefer complete, runnable module output. If you also give a patch, include both the patch and the full module.

Creativity prompt
- You are free to use non-greedy, "mystery" or randomized strategies. Try multi-start randomized construction, simulated annealing, genetic combination of candidate sets, or any hybrid approach. Explain briefly (as comments) the intuition behind why your approach might produce larger cap sets.

Safety notes
- Backup the original file before applying any automated patch. The evaluator enforces correctness at runtime.

Example of an allowed reply structure (preferred):

--- FULL MODULE START ---
```python
# Optional imports
import random
from itertools import product

_RANDOM_SEED = 42

def generate_set(n):
	# ... full implementation ...
	return []

if __name__ == '__main__':
	s = generate_set(4)
	print('cap set size=', len(s))
```
--- FULL MODULE END ---

--- PATCH START ---
<if also providing patch blocks>
--- PATCH END ---

Notes for the LLM:
- Full-module output is preferred. If you provide only a patch, also include the full module below the patch.
- Explain your approach briefly in comments at the top of the file.
