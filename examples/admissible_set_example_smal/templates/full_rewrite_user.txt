# TASK SPECIFICATION

Produce a complete, runnable Python module that constructs a large (n,w)-admissible set A in 𝔽₃ⁿ
following the definition below: 

1. Constant weight: every vector v ∈ A must satisfy `len(v) == n`, entries in {0,1,2}, and
	 `sum(1 for x in v if x != 0) == w`.

2. Unique supports: for any two distinct vectors u ≠ v in A, their supports (indices with nonzero
	 entries) must be different.

3. Triple existence: for every triple of *distinct* vectors (a, b, c) from A there must exist
	 at least one coordinate i where the multiset {a_i, b_i, c_i} (sorted) equals one of:
	 - [0, 0, 1]
	 - [0, 0, 2]
	 - [0, 1, 2]

Important: reproducibility is required. The module must use a module-level `_RANDOM_SEED` and seed all internal randomness from it.

## 1. Goal

Maximize |A| for an admissible set A of length-n vectors over {0,1,2} where each vector has exactly w nonzero entries.

The evaluator will call `generate_A(8, 4)` exactly once.

---

## 2. Core Constraint

The construction must be a **single greedy process**, where the global ordering of candidates is computed once (priorities are intrinsic-only) and then iterated deterministically.

Hint: You can exploit **symmetry** to construct relationships between coordinates to obtain better feature representations.

For example, you can **group coordinates** to reduce the solution space (i.e. consider the relationships among vec[i], vec[-i], vec[i - k], vec[i + k], and vec[(i + k) % n]).

---

## 3. Creativity

Feel free to be **bold** and **creative** when designing the **priority function**. Do not hesitate to explore aggressive heuristics or randomized components.

You are encouraged to **outperform** the current implementation rather than being constrained by the references. That is to say, you can adopt **completely different** methods that may lead to breakthroughs.

Performance gains take precedence over interpretability in the scoring design.

---

## 4. Optuna / Param Tuning

You could use **Optuna** to tune numeric hyperparameters for the priority function.

For certain key hyperparameters that are difficult to accurately give specific values, Optuna can be used to make more thorough attempts.

You should control the number of parameters, as too many parameters may result in ineffective parameter tuning within the limited time.

You should optimize for sufficiently many trials (e.g., at least 300 trials) to ensure effective parameter tuning.

Determinism (REASSERTED):

- Define a module-level `_RANDOM_SEED` and use it to seed the Python `random` module, NumPy (if used), and Optuna `TPESampler` (if used).
- Identical source + identical `_RANDOM_SEED` must produce identical output.

---

## 5. Implementation Requirements

Your module must define:

```python
def generate_A(n: int, w: int) -> List[List[int]]:
```

You may optionally structure code as:

```python
class GreedyAdmissibleGenerator:
```

Return only the full Python module source as your reply.

```python
<full module code>
```
