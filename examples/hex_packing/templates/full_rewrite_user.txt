# Full Rewrite Task — Hex Packing

You are given a program that outputs a candidate placement for placing 12 disjoint
regular hexagons of unit side length inside a larger regular hexagon.

Current performance metrics:
{metrics}

Program code:
```{language}
{current_program}
```

Task:
- Provide a complete replacement `solution = [...]` Python snippet or a JSON array
  containing 3*12 floats representing the improved (x,y,angle) triples.
- The new solution must ensure no two hexagons overlap and should minimize the
  side length of the containing regular hexagon.

Note about outer hexagon parameters:
- Your program MUST include the following top-level variables:
  - `outer_hex_center = (x, y)`
  - `outer_hex_side_length = <float>`
  - `outer_hex_angle_degrees = <float>`
  The evaluator will only validate these provided parameters and will NOT try
  to compute the containing hexagon automatically. If your program does not
  define these variables, the submission will be considered invalid.

Requirements:
- Output must be valid Python or JSON parseable by the evaluator.

Be precise and return only the solution.
